# PhotoshopScripts
This is a repository of photoshop and photopea scripts that I've created to help speed up certain tasks

## How to Use
In Photoshop goto `File->Scripts->Browse...` and locate the script you want to use and it will automatically run it.

In Photopea goto `File->Script` and paste in the script you want to run inside the window. Then click Run at the bottom. You can also just save the script so you don't have to load it every time.
